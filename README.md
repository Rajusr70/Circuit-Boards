#Circuit-Boards

A collection of my open-source designs

##On to the projects!

* **ADSP-21477...** - Breaks out the 88-QFN package of this DSP from Analog Devices
* **CS4344**  - Breaks out this Analog to Digital Converter from Cirrus
* **CS5343**  - Breaks out this Digital to Analog Converter from Cirrus
* **TLC5947 Old** - A board from when I used to layout without using a schematic.  Uses two TLC5947 ICs to manage 16 5050 RGB LEDS
* **Lego type WS2812** - A modular LED board made to connect to other pieces to make any LED display
* **Neopixel** - My board made after the Neopixel from Adafruit
* **Version 1 WS2812** - A square board using the WS2812 LEDs to make an LED matrix
* **Smod Boards** - These boards were made for half fun and half the University of Wisconsin - Stout IEEE
* **Stout IEEE Dev Board** - This is a development board in the form of an Arduino based off of the ATmega16 for UW-Stout IEEE.  Includes onboard programming based off of an ATtiny45.


More projects and such will be added soon.  I pretty much make a new one everyday.
