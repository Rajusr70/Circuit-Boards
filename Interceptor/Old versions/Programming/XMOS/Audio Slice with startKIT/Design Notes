Design Notes:

-Maybe include seperate modes where if either the ADC or DAC aren't going to be used,
 turn the unused one off in one mode and in another, just mute it.  
 This would play into the concept of a portable battery powered product.

-Possibly include a "test" mode where more CPU is dedicated to processing of the signal
 to get amplitude and actual measurements like a test tool would
 The output of a led visualization would be entirely optional at this point
